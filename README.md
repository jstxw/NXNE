# NXNE Application (IMCE 2025)

NXNE: This image detection app is a powerful, cross-platform tool built using Flutter and integrated with a custom-trained YOLOv8 model. Designed for real-time object detection, the app enables users to scan and identify objects instantly using their mobile device's camera. Built for the 2025 ICDC (International Career Developement Conference) in Florida. 

The underlying model was trained on a diverse and well-labeled dataset sourced from the Open Images Dataset V7 and prepared using Roboflow to ensure compatibility with YOLOv8. Training was conducted in Google Colab, utilizing free GPU acceleration for efficiency and scalability.

The app delivers fast and accurate detection performance, whether running on Android or iOS. iOS deployment was achieved through a virtual macOS setup and Xcode, enabling smooth testing and distribution on Apple devices. The result is a streamlined, responsive, and highly functional image recognition app, ideal for real-time use in a variety of environments.
